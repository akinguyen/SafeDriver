# SafeDriver

The safe driving device can read the driver's face and determine if their eyes are open and focused ahead. If the driver falls 
asleep or takes their eyes off the road for more than 2 seconds, the chosen song will begin to play to alert the driver to pay 
attention to the road in order to ensure they can get to their destination safely. The total cost for this life-saver device is under 50$!
